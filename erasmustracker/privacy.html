    <h2>What We Don't Collect</h2>
    
    <p><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> The app does not request, access, or store names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, or any other personally identifying information.</p>
    
    <p><strong>No Usage Analytics:</strong> The app does not track how you use it, which features you access, or how frequently you use the application. No telemetry or analytics services are present.</p>
    
    <p><strong>No Device Information:</strong> The app does not access or collect device identifiers, IP addresses, location data, or technical information about your device.</p>
    
    <p><strong>No Account Creation:</strong> The app requires no registration, login, or account creation of any kind.</p>
    
    <p><strong>No External Servers:</strong> The app does not connect to any external servers, APIs, or third-party services for data storage or processing.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All trip data, expenses, budgets, and settings you enter are stored locally on your device using Apple's standard data storage frameworks.</p>
    
    <p><strong>iCloud Sync:</strong> If you enable iCloud sync, your data is transmitted securely to your personal iCloud account using Apple's end-to-end encryption. We never have access to this data. iCloud sync is controlled entirely by Apple's infrastructure and follows Apple's privacy policies.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Receipt Photos:</strong> Photos you attach to expenses are stored locally on your device and/or in your personal iCloud Drive. They are never uploaded to our servers or shared with third parties.</p>
    
    <h2>Face ID</h2>
    <p>If you enable Face ID protection in settings, authentication happens entirely on your device using Apple's secure biometric framework. No facial recognition data is transmitted, stored by the app, or accessible to us in any way.</p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Erasmus Tracker does not integrate with, connect to, or share data with any third-party services, advertising networks, analytics platforms, or external APIs.</p>
    
    <h2>Permissions</h2>

    <p>• <strong>Camera/Photo Library:</strong> Only when you choose to attach a receipt photo to an expense. Photos are stored locally or in your iCloud Drive.<br>
    • <strong>Face ID:</strong> Only if you enable biometric protection in settings. Authentication occurs entirely on-device.</p>

    <p>• Contacts or calendar<br>
    • Location services<br>
    • Microphone<br>
    • Health data<br>
    • Any other sensors or personal information</p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Since Erasmus Tracker collects no personal data and connects to no external servers, it is safe for users of all ages. However, the app is designed for educators managing mobility projects and is not intended for children.</p>

    <p>• All data stored locally on your device using Apple's secure storage frameworks<br>
    • Optional Face ID protection for app access<br>
    • iCloud data encrypted in transit and at rest by Apple's infrastructure<br>
    • No transmission of data to external servers or third parties</p>
    
    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since all data remains on your device:</p>
    <p>• You maintain complete control over your data<br>
    • You can delete the app and all data at any time<br>
    • You can disable iCloud sync in iOS Settings → iCloud<br>
    • No data deletion requests are necessary because we have no access to your data</p>
    
    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>This app is an independent project and is not officially endorsed by, affiliated with, or approved by the European Commission, the Erasmus+ Programme, or any National Agency. All Erasmus+ trademarks and terminology are used solely for descriptive purposes.</p>
